## Initial Post
My first post made on this blog. In this blog I will document my progress across the various projects that I 
currently have. My interests are multifaceted ranging from systems programming, applications programming,
theoretical computer science, artificial intelligence and computer graphics. With systems programming I am 
currently messing around with an Arduino Uno R3. Trying to gain an understanding in physical electrical 
components. I also am working on a mini project in making a shell in C as well. In the space of applications
I am working on several projects. A first person fps puzzle platformer in Godot. A React web app utilizing the 
Gemini API. 

## Projects Overview
### Main Projects
* Fps Puzzle platformer Godot
* Gemini React Web app
* Arduino Uno R3 projects

### Side Projects
* Shell in C
* Learning DSL in Racket
* 2D game in Godot

## About Me
I am currently exploring my interests in computer science, mathematics, and science mainly. But my interests also lie 
in history, literature, linguistics, psychology, music, and philosophy. I possess a BS in Computer Science. My main goal to 
have a holistic understanding of computers but also the world.
